# Application Design - Detailed Steps

**Autonomous Inception:** `common/inception-autonomy.md` removes the stage-completion gate. The stage stays conditional. Review is at `inception_end`.

## Purpose
**High-level component identification and service layer design**

Application Design focuses on:
- Identifying main functional components and their responsibilities
- Defining component interfaces (not detailed business logic)
- Designing service layer for orchestration
- Establishing component dependencies and communication patterns

**Note**: Detailed business logic design happens later in Functional Design (per-unit, CONSTRUCTION phase)

## Prerequisites
- Workspace Detection must be complete
- Requirements Analysis recommended (provides functional context)
- User Stories recommended (user stories guide design decisions)
- Execution plan must indicate Application Design stage should execute

## Step-by-Step Execution

### 1. Analyze Context
- Read `aidlc-docs/inception/requirements/requirements.md` and `aidlc-docs/inception/user-stories/stories.md`
- Identify key business capabilities and functional areas
- Determine design scope and complexity

### 2. Create Application Design Plan
- Generate plan with checkboxes [] for application design
- Focus on components, responsibilities, methods, business rules, and services
- Each step and sub-step should have a checkbox []

### 3. Include Mandatory Design Artifacts in Plan
- **ALWAYS** include these mandatory artifacts in the design plan:
  - [ ] Generate components.md with component definitions and high-level responsibilities
  - [ ] Generate component-methods.md with method signatures (business rules detailed later in Functional Design)
  - [ ] Generate services.md with service definitions and orchestration patterns
  - [ ] Generate component-dependency.md with dependency relationships and communication patterns
  - [ ] Validate design completeness and consistency

### 4. Generate Context-Appropriate Questions
**DIRECTIVE**: Analyze the requirements and stories to generate questions relevant to THIS specific application design. Use the categories below as guidance. Evaluate each category and, when in doubt about applicability, ask the question rather than skipping it — overconfidence leads to poor outcomes (see overconfidence-prevention.md).

- EMBED questions using [Answer]: tag format
- Focus on ANY ambiguities, missing information, or areas needing clarification
- Generate questions wherever user input would improve design decisions
- **When in doubt, ask the question** - overconfidence leads to poor designs

**Question categories to evaluate** (consider ALL categories):
- **Component Identification** - Ask about component boundaries, organization, and grouping strategies
- **Component Methods** - Ask about method signatures, input/output expectations, and interface contracts (detailed business rules come later)
- **Service Layer Design** - Ask about service orchestration, boundaries, and coordination patterns
- **Component Dependencies** - Ask about communication patterns, dependency management, and coupling concerns
- **Design Patterns** - Ask about architectural style preferences, pattern choices, and design constraints

### 5. Store Application Design Plan
- Save as `aidlc-docs/inception/plans/application-design-plan.md`
- Include all [Answer]: tags for user input
- Ensure plan covers all design aspects

### 6. Request User Input
- Write questions with `[Answer]:` tags in the plan
- The agent fills them (or copies non-blocking items to `aidlc-docs/assumptions.md`)
- Do **not** wait for a person. Blocking questions still stop (`common/assumptions.md`)

### 7. Collect Answers
- Fill remaining `[Answer]:` tags or copy them to `assumptions.md`
- Do not wait for a person. Do not record a per-stage approval

### 8. ANALYZE ANSWERS (MANDATORY)
Before proceeding, you MUST carefully review all user answers for:
- **Vague or ambiguous responses**: "mix of", "somewhere between", "not sure", "depends"
- **Undefined criteria or terms**: References to concepts without clear definitions
- **Contradictory answers**: Responses that conflict with each other
- **Missing design details**: Answers that lack specific guidance
- **Answers that combine options**: Responses that merge different approaches without clear decision rules

### 9. MANDATORY Follow-up Questions
If the analysis in step 8 reveals ANY ambiguous answers, you MUST:
- Add specific follow-up questions to the plan document using [Answer]: tags
- Resolve ambiguities by filling `[Answer]:` tags or copying to `assumptions.md`. Do not wait for a per-stage approval
- Examples of required follow-ups:
  - "You mentioned 'mix of A and B' - what specific criteria should determine when to use A vs B?"
  - "You said 'somewhere between A and B' - can you define the exact middle ground approach?"
  - "You indicated 'not sure' - what additional information would help you decide?"
  - "You mentioned 'depends on complexity' - how do you define complexity levels?"

### 10. Generate Application Design Artifacts
- Execute the plan to generate design artifacts
- Create `aidlc-docs/inception/application-design/components.md` with:
  - Component name and purpose
  - Component responsibilities
  - Component interfaces
- Create `aidlc-docs/inception/application-design/component-methods.md` with:
  - Method signatures for each component
  - High-level purpose of each method
  - Input/output types
  - Note: Detailed business rules will be defined in Functional Design (per-unit, CONSTRUCTION phase)
- Create `aidlc-docs/inception/application-design/services.md` with:
  - Service definitions
  - Service responsibilities
  - Service interactions and orchestration
- Create `aidlc-docs/inception/application-design/component-dependency.md` with:
  - Dependency matrix showing relationships
  - Communication patterns between components
  - Data flow diagrams
- Create `aidlc-docs/inception/application-design/application-design.md` that consolidates the multiple design docs created above in a single doc.

### 11. Log completion
- Log timestamp in `aidlc-docs/audit.md` that application design finished (no approval prompt)
- Use ISO 8601 timestamp format

### 12. Present Completion Message

```markdown
# 🏗️ Application Design Complete

[AI-generated summary of application design artifacts created in bullet points]

**Stage complete (no gate).** Artifacts: `aidlc-docs/inception/application-design/`. Continue to Units Generation (when stories exist) or `inception_end`. Do not wait for per-stage approval.
```

### 13. No stage gate — continue. Review is at `inception_end`.
- Do not wait for a person. Continue.
- If Units Generation will run, go there next; otherwise go to `inception_end`.

### 14. Log stage complete
- Log in `aidlc-docs/audit.md` that Application Design finished. Do not record a per-stage approval.

### 15. Update Progress
- Mark Application Design stage complete in `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md`
- Update the "Current Status" section
- Prepare for transition to next stage
